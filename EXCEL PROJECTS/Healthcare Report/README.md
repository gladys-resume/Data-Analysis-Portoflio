# Healthcare Analytics Project - Abua Region (2019-2024)
## Industry: Healthcare
## Tool(s): Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Charts)
## Dataset Source: Open Health Dataset (Kaggle)

### 1. Introduction
This project explores healthcare data from the Abua region, spanning 2019 to 2024. The analysis examines patient records, hospital performance, 
treatment patterns, and operational trends within the region’s healthcare system.

### 2. Objective
The objective of this project is to uncover meaningful insights from healthcare records within the Abua region by analyzing patient demographics,
hospital activity, treatment patterns, insurance distribution and seasonal admission changes. Through this work, I aim to identify trends, patterns 
and performance indicators that can support healthcare practitioners and decision-makers in improving service delivery and resource planning.

### 3. Why This Analysis Matters
This analysis is important because healthcare leaders rely on accurate information to improve patient care, plan budgets and allocate resources effectively. 
By transforming raw data into insight, the project helps stakeholders understand patient demand, monitor operational performance, and identify areas where 
improvements or investments are needed. Ultimately, these insights can influence policy decisions, strengthen hospital systems and contribute to better health 
outcomes for people living in the Abua region.

### 4. Problem Statements / Key Questions Answered
The analysis seeks to answer the following business questions:
   
    a. Patient Volume Trends: How do patient counts vary over time by age group, gender, hospital, and admission type?
    
    b. Cost and Length of Stay: What factors influence average treatment cost and how long patients stay in hospital?
    
    c. Hospital Performance: Which hospitals receive the most patients? Which facilities show the best throughput?
    
    d. Medication & Test Result Patterns: Which medications are most commonly administered? What distribution trends exist in test outcomes?
    
    e. Insurance Impact: How are patients distributed across insurance providers? What implications exist for reimbursement and billing strategies?
    
    f. Seasonality: Are there admission spikes or declines across months or seasons? How should facility staffing adjust to these patterns?

### 5. Data Overview
The dataset used in this project is an open-access healthcare record obtained from Kaggle and contains patient information from 2019 to 2024. 
The data includes essential variables such as patient demographics (age and gender), blood type, medical condition, hospital attended, attending doctor, 
treatment cost, length of stay, medication administered, test results, and insurance provider. These fields provide a broad view of healthcare activities 
in the Abua region and form the basis for all subsequent analysis.

### 6. Methodology
This analysis was completed using Microsoft Excel, with Power Query employed for data cleaning and transformation. Duplicate entries were removed, 
missing values were addressed, and data types were standardized to improve accuracy. Pivot tables were created to summarize key measures, analyze 
trends, and observe group-level comparisons. Visualizations were developed using Excel charts to display findings in a clear and understandable format.
Excel was selected for this project because it allows for faster exploratory analysis, offers flexible data manipulation, and is suitable for medium-sized 
datasets making it ideal for building foundational analytics projects.

### 7. Key Findings (Summary)
Notable insights extracted from the dataset include:
   
    a. Total number of patients treated across all years
    
    b. Top 5 most visited hospitals
    
    c. Top 10 attending doctors by patient volume
    
    d. Year-on-year patient admission trends
    
    e. Most common medical conditions recorded
    
    f. Insurance providers covering majority patient share

### 8. Recommendations
The data shows that some hospitals receive more patients than others, especially Smith Group and Smith PLC. These hospitals may need more staff, space, or equipment to reduce pressure and avoid long waiting times. Hospitals with fewer patients could improve by creating awareness, improving service quality, or offering more community support so people know where to go for care.
Most patients are coming in with conditions like obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. This means the region should focus more on health education and prevention. Community programs, screenings, and lifestyle support could help reduce how many people need hospital treatment.
Two main insurance providers carry most of the patient numbers. Working more closely with these companies can help hospitals process payments faster and plan better for budgeting. Hospitals may also consider incentives that attract patients from other insurance providers.
A few doctors handle a very large number of cases. This may cause burnout or slow treatment over time. Hospitals should try to spread cases more evenly, support busy doctors, or bring in more specialists where needed.
Finally, since patient totals have dropped in the last year and many patients are middle-aged or older, hospitals should explore why fewer people came in and plan services that match the needs of aging patients.
