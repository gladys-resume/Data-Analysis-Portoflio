# Employee Insights Report - Hi-Tech Workforce Analysis (2018-2021)
## Industry: Corporate / Human Resources
## Tools: Power BI (Power Query, Data Modelling, DAX, Interactive Dashboards)
## Data Source: Open Employee Dataset

### 1. Introduction
This project explores workforce trends within Hi-Tech by analysing staff records across multiple units and locations. The goal is to understand the organisation’s employee structure, salary distribution, hiring behaviour, and long-term retention patterns in order to support better HR planning and operational decisions.

### 2. Objectives
The analysis focuses on three major areas:
Employee Overview: understanding the makeup of the workforce
Pay Analysis: reviewing salary patterns by unit, location, and qualification
Onboarding Insights: examining hiring trends, demographics and retention

### 3. Key metrics
This report answers several analytical questions, including:
  a. How many employees work in Hi-Tech, and how are they distributed across units and locations?
  
  b. What employee qualifications and job statuses are most common?
  
  c. Which business units offer the highest salary averages?
  
  d. How does pay differ by qualification and location?
  
  e. What does onboarding look like in terms of gender, age, and timing?
  
  f. Which employees have stayed longest with the organisation?

### 4. Dataset Overview &  Methodology
The dataset includes records for employees working in different Hi-Tech offices, covering fields such as staff name, unit, job type, qualification, location, employment status, salary, age, gender, and hiring dates. These variables make it possible to track headcount, assess pay structures, and observe hiring patterns over time. Power BI was used for data cleaning, modelling, and dashboard development.
 Power Query enabled the removal of duplicates, null entries, empty spaces, and data type errors.
 Dimension tables were created for key variables such as qualification, job type, sex, status, and unit, ensuring relationships were properly defined for accurate analysis and data modeling.
 Interactive visuals, slicers, and page navigation buttons were added to make the dashboard user-friendly and allow stakeholders to explore insights from multiple angles. 
           a. **Employee Overview:** This highlights the total number of staff and how they are grouped by unit, office location, and 
                employment status. The analysis also shows how many employees 
                are present in each location and what qualifications are most common across the organisation. This helps management 
                understand staffing strengths and where hiring gaps may exist.
          
           b. **Pay Analysis:** Salary patterns were explored across units, qualification levels, and locations.  Average pay metrics were 
                calculated to identify where employees earn the most and 
               whether education level or unit assignment influences compensation. The review also highlights the top five highest-paying 
               units, giving the organisation a clearer picture of cost 
               distribution within its workforce.
           
           c. **Onboarding Insights:** Employee onboarding data shows a fairly balanced gender intake with 129 male employees and 124 
                female employees. Age distribution analysis reveals the most 
                represented age groups in the company, while onboarding trends highlight periods of high recruitment activity. The 
                analysis also identifies the top five employees with the longest years 
                of service, providing insight into retention and loyalty across the organisation.
### 5. Recommendations
Hi-Tech should take advantage of the strong number of tenured staff. Many employees have stayed for several years, which shows loyalty and job stability. The company can build on this by offering more career development, training, and internal promotion opportunities to retain experienced workers.
Pay varies widely across units, with a few departments earning much higher than others. It may be useful to review why some units receive higher salaries and ensure pay differences match workload, skill needs, and business goals. Units with lower average pay may also need review to avoid future staff turnover.
Employee onboarding is not consistent from year to year. Since some years show stronger hiring, HR may want to understand what influenced the drop in 2021 and plan better for steady yearly recruitment. This will help prevent staffing shortages in key teams.
Gender distribution is balanced, which is a strength. Hi-Tech should continue policies that support equal hiring and promotion for both men and women. The company may also explore ways to increase female representation in higher-paying or technical units if needed.
Age and service data show most employees fall between 35 and 45 and many top contributors have been with the company for over 10 years. As staff age, succession planning is important. HR may need to prepare younger workers to take over leadership roles when long-serving employees transition.
Finally, with four locations and seventeen units, workforce placement should be reviewed regularly. Units with high workloads and strong salary budgets may require extra headcount, while slower units may need role redesign or restructuring to optimize productivity.
 Tracking long-serving employees may also help HR understand which roles retain talent and where support or engagement programs may be needed for newer staff.
### 6. Conclusion
 This analysis provides a clear overview of Hi-Tech’s workforce structure, salary patterns, and hiring activity.  The insights reveal areas of strength as well as opportunities to improve staff placement, cost control, and talent development.
 Continuous monitoring of employee data will support more informed workforce decisions and long-term organisational planning.
